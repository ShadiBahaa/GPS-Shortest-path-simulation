# GPS Shortest path simulation
## A simulation for the way that GPS checks for the shortest path between any two positions. The project is a 5x5 matrix represents 25 different positions and each position is marked as 0 or 1.
## if the position is marked as 1, it means that is blocked and path cannot include it.
## By Entering the whole matrix as zeros and ones, and entering the row and column of the source and destination positions, the console will print for you all paths from source to destination, with specifying which one is the shortest.
## The project is based on single linked list and DFS algorithm
